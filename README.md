# Y-Net: Joint Segmentation and Classification for Diagnosis of Breast Biopsy Images
This repository contains the source code for our paper, [YNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01313), which is accepted for publication at [MICCAI'18](https://www.miccai2018.org/en/).

## Sample output of Y-Net

Y-Net  identified correctly classified tissues that were not important for diagnosis. For example, stroma was identified as an important tissue, but blood was not. Stroma is an important tissue label for diagnosing breast cancer [1] and removing information about stroma decreased the diagnostic classification accuracy by about  4\%. See paper for more details.

## Structure of this repository
YNet is trained in two stages:
* [stage1](/stage1/) This directory contains the source code for training the stage 1 in Y-Net. Stage 1 is nothing but a segmentation brach.
* [stage2](/stage2/) This directory contains the source code for training the stage 2 in Y-Net. Stage 2 is jointly learning the segmentation and classification.
* [seg_eval](/seg_eval/) This directory contains the source code for producing the segmentation masks. 

## Pre-requisite

To run this code, you need to have following libraries:
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - We tested our code with version 3.3.0. If you are using other versions, please change the source code accordingly.
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) - We tested with v0.2.0_4. If you are using other versions, please change the source code accordingly.
* Python - We tested our code with Python 3.6.2 (Anaconda custom 64-bit). If you are using other Python versions, please feel free to make necessary changes to the code. 

We recommend to use [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/linux.html). We have tested our code on Ubuntu 16.04.
